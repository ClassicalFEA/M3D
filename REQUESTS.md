# Feature Requests

### 1. Line Separator

Include a line separate in the bottom right window. This will help break up the sections for visual identification.

### 2. Impove Materials and Properties User-Friendliness

For the Materials and Properties window, add a 3rd column that will show the currently availble ID numbers.

### 3. View Toggle States

When using the View menu, many of the options are toggles. However the state of the toggle is not shown. For example display shell thickness does not show the state.
By comparison, the View/Status Bar shows the state.

### 4. Nodes On/Off Not Working?

When toggling the nodes on/off, this feature does not appear to take effect.

### 5. Fit All in View 

This featuer does not appear to be working, even when only the nodes are considered for the fitting.

### 6. Picking Improvment

Selecting appears to be "cummulative". That is, for each pick, it adds to the current pick selection. How can you remove only a portion of what has been picked? 

### 7. Spin Center

How you do you set the spin center?

### 8. How to create SOL103 and SOL105 solutions?

How you do you set the spin center?

### 9. Post Processing Scaling

For the displacement post-processing, can an auto scale be done (wich also shows the associated true scale)? For example, an auto-scale may have the max deformation be 10% of the max of the envelope dimensions of the model.

### 10. Break Out Right Status Window

Is it possible to break out the right status window from the command input window? In general the command windows is probably better as being wide, while the right status window is probably better being tall.

### 11. All Done Option

Create an "all done" option to go along with Cancel and Done.
